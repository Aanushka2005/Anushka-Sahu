# ATM Simulation Project

This project is a simple Python-based ATM simulation designed for beginners. It demonstrates basic concepts of functions, conditional statements, loops, and dictionary-based data handling.
This project shows how real applications . take input from users,validate PIN, process choices .The code stimulates like adding balance, reducing balance and preventing over withdrawal.
#  Features

Check current account balance

Deposit money in your account

Withdraw money frm your account

PIN authentication , Reset PIN

Menu-driven interface

# How to Run

1. Install Python (if not installed).


2. Save the code in a file named atm.py.


3. Open terminal/command prompt.


4. Run:

python atm.py

5. Enter the PIN when prompted.



Default PIN in this project:

2005

Account Details Used

account = {
    'pin': 2005,
    'balance': 5000
}

You can modify balance or PIN inside the code.


#  Example Operations

1️. Check Balance

Displays your available balance.

2️. Deposit Money

Adds entered amount to your account.
3 Withdraw Money
